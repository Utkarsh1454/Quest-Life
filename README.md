## 🏗️ System Architecture  

A **modular and scalable directory structure**:

```
GameHub/
├── index.html        # Entry point
├── html/             # Auth flows & game views
├── css/              # Global styles & UI system
├── js/               # Core logic & engines
├── images/           # Assets
└── scripts/          # Python automation tools
```

### 🔧 Design Philosophy
- Separation of concerns (UI / logic / assets)  
- Reusable components via global injection  
- Scalable game modules
